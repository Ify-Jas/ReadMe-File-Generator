# ReadME generator with Node.js and ES6

  ## Description
  This project was about utilising all we learnt about back end command line programming using Node.js and ES6. The project was really enjoyable to follow through using topics like object programming and tapping into my knowledge of functions. This project heavily relies on the use of npm packages specifically inquirer.

  This work generates a a ReadMe file using best practises, saving the user lots of time in doing it from scratch. It is not limited to a readme file as this can also be adjusted to create other files that can be used for other purpose.

  ## Installation
  The user will need to download Node.js onto their system, then run a NPM init, NPM install inquirer.

  If the user already has this, then all that is needed is a git clone and run in the command line by calling 'node index.js'.

  
  ## Usage
  See video of a test run below;
